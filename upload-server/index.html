  If you are a hacker, please do not hack on this. This site is only up for a couple of weeks so it was not worth the effort for me to harden it. 
  None of the data here is canonical. If you figure out a way to upload more tiles or delete someoneelses tiles, you are just makimg work
  for me to fix it. There is nothing to gain except wasting your time and my time. No glory.

  Thanks,
  josh
